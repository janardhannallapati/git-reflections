You can compare the code between versions that helps to narrow down files.
easy to identfy bugs by looking at history of file changes.
if you autoversion like google docs, there is no way to find what changes related to what fix.

git log
  is used to see commit history

git diff

  is used to compare one commit with another.
  We can always go back to old code that is working and fix bugs introduced in new code.
